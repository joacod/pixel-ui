Color system refactor and shadow system improvements

- Enhanced dark mode color adaptation for better contrast and accessibility
- Refined shadow system with consistent 3D effect across components
- Improved shadow transitions between normal and focus states (2px to 3px)
- Better shadow color contrast in dark mode with inverted shadows
- Consistent shadow behavior across all interactive states (hover, focus, active)
