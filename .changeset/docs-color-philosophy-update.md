Clarify "plug and play" philosophy in documentation

This release updates the documentation to better emphasize the library's zero-configuration approach and variant-based color usage.

- Updated colors.mdx documentation to emphasize variant-based usage over direct color imports
- Simplified index.mdx to highlight "plug and play" approach with zero configuration
