---

## Installation

Install pixel-ui using your preferred package manager:

```package-install
@joacod/pixel-ui
```

## Peer Dependencies

pixel-ui requires the following peer dependencies:

```package-install
react react-dom
```

That's it! Tailwind CSS and Base UI are already bundled with the library, no additional configuration needed.

## Setup

### Import Pixel UI Styles

In your app's main CSS file (e.g., `app/globals.css` or `src/index.css`):

```css
@import '@joacod/pixel-ui/components';
```

This single import includes everything you need:

- ✅ **Design tokens** - NES-inspired 8-bit color palette, 8px grid spacing, pixel fonts
- ✅ **Tailwind utilities** - Pre-built utility classes for layout and styling
- ✅ **Base utilities** - Pixel-art helpers like `.pixel-border`, `.pixel-render`, `.pixel-text`
- ✅ **Component styles** - Ready-to-use styles for Button, Input, Checkbox, and all other components

## Usage

You can now import and use pixel-ui components:

```tsx
import { Button } from '@joacod/pixel-ui'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Button variant="primary" size="md">
      Click me!
    </Button>
  )
}
```

## TypeScript Support

pixel-ui is written in TypeScript and includes type definitions out of the box. No additional setup is required.

## Troubleshooting

### Styles not applying

If your styles aren't working, check:

1. **CSS import is present** - Verify `@import '@joacod/pixel-ui/components'` is in your main CSS file
2. **Build process** - Restart your dev server after adding the CSS import

### TypeScript errors with peer dependencies

Ensure you have all peer dependencies installed:

```package-install
npm install react react-dom
```
