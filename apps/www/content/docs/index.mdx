## Philosophy

pixel-ui embraces the charm of classic 8-bit and 16-bit era interfaces while providing modern React patterns and accessibility features. Every component is designed to be:

1. **Simple** - Import and use, no configuration needed
2. **Accessible** - Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support
3. **Performant** - Minimal runtime overhead with CSS-based styling
