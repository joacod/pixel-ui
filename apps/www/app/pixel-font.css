/**
 * Pixel UI Font - Global Import
 *
 * This file imports the Unifontex pixel font globally so it's available
 * inside Shadow DOM components. The font is needed for pixel-ui components
 * but is loaded globally since @font-face rules with relative URLs don't
 * work correctly inside shadow roots.
 *
 * This is the ONLY pixel-ui style imported globally - all other styles
 * are scoped within Shadow DOM boundaries.
